# gamejam-floatilla

An attempt at https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5, whose theme is "Better Together".  Slapping this thing together while the baby is asleep, mostly as an attempt to put some of what I've been learning about Unity into practice.

As you can tell from the Projects section, I spent more time daydreaming about what I could do than actaully sitting in front of Unity *doing* something.  Oh well, such is life.
